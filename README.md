MacStub creates a replacement for the JavaApplicationStub that is distributed with Java-based applications for the Mac.  Many apps still distribute a JavaApplicationStub that only work with the Apple version of Java 6 and below.  Being that we are typically installing OpenJava 7 or 8, those apps do not launch.

Partly inspired by Tobias Fischer's [Universal JavaApplicationStub] (https://github.com/tofi86/universalJavaApplicationStub) bash script, this project is really just an excuse for me to play with and learn the [Go](http://golang.org/) language by solving a problem.  I'm sure the code here is not idiomatic Go, as this is just a learning exercise.
